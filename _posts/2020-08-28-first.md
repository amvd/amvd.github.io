It's been a while since I've tried to start a personal blog, and there's nothing like a pandemic to spur the effort.

I'm working on some new things and figured I would try to write about it. I'm using Jekyll because, well, lots of people use it, and I already have my hands in a bunc of different efforts without having to learn another cutting edge platform. I would have gone with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) if I'd ever gotten around to learning Go (or at least, finishing learning it) and I was looking at [Elder.js](https://elderguide.com/tech/elderjs/) since I've been really interested in Svelte lately, but I really don't want to be on the bleeding edge of some new static site software when all I want is a simple blog.

So here I am.
