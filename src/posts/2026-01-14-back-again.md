Well, times have certainly changed since 2020. And I guess, so have I.

It's a new world, and as every modern programmer has had to do over the last couple decades if not longer, I've had to adapt.

I remember occasionally needing (wanting? lol) to correct my friends when they would talk about "AI" taking over.

"It's 'machine learning'," I would tell them. It was just a machine trying to analyze patterns and reproduce them, turning photos into
images of cats or anime characters, generating text made to look intelligible even if it was complete gibberish, etc.

And I mean, it's not _not_ that, even now.

But it's undeniable that the capacities of modern "AI" have reached the point of _something_ akin to intelligence. They can understand
the context and intent of what we say to them, they can incorporate prior knowledge and external sources information, they can infer
and reflect on their own reasoning.

They are, in a way many have failed to predict even after all the science fiction pertaining to it, _intelligent_.

And they are currently trying very hard to finish my sentences... For all the ways I've actually learned to enjoy Google's Antigravity
helping me, that is not really one of them. Sorry, Gemini.

This was in fact what I was about to write.

I've seen decent writing by Gemini, but it's not exactly Antigravity's strong suit.

This was...not.

But here I am, over-engineering my personal site with AI. And honestly, I can understand the hype. It's not particularly difficult to set up
a basic site with Svelte, but features and refactors that would have taken hours now take mere seconds. I've been building some personal
projects from scratch and things that would have taken literal days now take hours if not minutes. Ideas I've had in my head for years,
I can now create a very polished looking MVP in a day.

As much as I have to begrudgingly admit, building things is [fun again](https://ma.ttias.be/web-development-is-fun-again/).
